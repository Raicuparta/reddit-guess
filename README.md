# Why
I wanted to give [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) a shot, so I made this small game.

# How
It fetches the posts from any pic-based subreddit and tries its best to use the pictures and titles for the game. I didn't really do much to prevent it from exploding when unexpected formats show up, and only tested extensively with the default subreddit being used ([/r/MixedRaceGirls](https://www.reddit.com/r/MixedRaceGirls)).

# Demo
[mixed-guess.surge.sh](http://mixed-guess.surge.sh/)

### Also works with other pic-based subreddits
